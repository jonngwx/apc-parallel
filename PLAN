we want to solve the heat equation, dT/dt = k del^2 T in serial and parallel using OMP and MPI

This will use an explicit euler for time stepping and centred finite differences in space. Boundary conditions in x are T(x,0) = cos^2 x, T(x, pi ) = sin^2 x, T(0,y) = T(pi,y)

To reduce code duplication, there will be an interface which does all the solving

Interface Model - containing the grid and equation and time stepper and boundary conditions. // may want to split the time stepper
boundary conditions should be handled by the solver and defined by the model. MPI version will decide whether to use internal or external.
